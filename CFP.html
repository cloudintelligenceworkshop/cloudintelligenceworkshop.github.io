							<h3>Overview</h3>
							<p>Digital transformation is happening in all industries. Running businesses on top of cloud services (e.g., SaaS, PaaS, IaaS) is becoming the core of digital transformation. However, the large-scale and high complexity of cloud services brings great challenges to the industry. There is an emerging trend of infusing AI into every aspect of the design, development, and operations of cloud service systems, we call it AIOps. We envision that, with the advance of AIOps technologies, the cloud industry will achieve significant progress in the following aspects while keeping a sustained and exponential growth:

										Cloud Intelligence / AIOps: Infusing AI/ML into all aspects of the design, development, and operations of cloud service systems
									</div>
								</div>
							<h5>• Autonomous and high-quality cloud service. Cloud services will have built-in capabilities of self-monitoring, self-diagnosis, and self-healing – all with low human intervention (thus low operation cost) without compromising the service quality or the user experience.</h5>
							<h5>•	Highly efficient and effective DevOps (Developer and Operations). Engineers are empowered with intelligent tools to (1) build new capabilities of services and smoothly roll out new capabilities to users; (2) efficiently operate production services.</h5>
							<h5>•	Intelligence at users’ fingertips. Users can easily use, maintain, and troubleshoot their workloads or get efficient support on top of the underlying cloud service offerings.</h5>
							The industry is still at an early stage towards realizing this vision. We advocate the urgency of driving and accelerating AI/ML for efficient and manageable cloud services through collaborative efforts in multiple areas including but not limited to artificial intelligence, machine learning, software engineering, data analytics, and systems. This workshop provides a forum for researchers and practitioners to present the state of research and practice, and new ideas, in this area, and network with colleagues.
							</p>
							<h3>Topics</h3>
							<p>The workshop encourages submissions on innovative technologies and applications in cloud intelligence / AIOps. Topics of interest include AI/ML related techniques, methodologies, solutions, and experiences for cloud service systems, DevOps, and customers.</p>
							<h5>• New design, development, and operational patterns</h5>
							<h5>• Development of cloud services systems</h5>
							<h5>• Deployment and integration testing</h5>
							<h5>• System configuration</h5>
							<h5>• Service quality monitoring and anomaly detection</h5>
							<h5>• Resource scheduling and optimization</h5>
							<h5>• Capacity/workload management and prediction</h5>
							<h5>• Hardware/software failure prediction</h5>
							<h5>• Auto-diagnosis and problem localization</h5>
							<h5>• Incident management</h5>
							<h5>• Auto service healing</h5>
							<h5>• Datacenter management</h5>
							<h5>• Customer support</h5>
							<h5>• Security</h5>
							<h5>• Privacy</h5>
							<br/>
							<h3>Attendance Expectation</h3>
							<p>If a submission is accepted, at least one author of the paper is required to register for the workshop and present the paper.</p>
							<h3>Abstract and Paper Submission</h3>
							<p>The workshop invites submission of manuscripts with original work that have not been previously published and that are not currently under review by another conference and journal. Submissions will be assessed based on their novelty, technical quality, potential impact, interest, clarity, relevance, and reproducibility. Submitted papers will be peer-reviewed and selected for oral or poster presentation. Accepted papers will be published in the ICSE 2021 workshop proceedings in ACM Digital Library and IEEE Xplore Digital Library.</p>
							<p>Submissions must be in PDF format, no more than six pages for formal papers and two pages for project showcases, including all content and references. Submissions must be formatted according to the instructions at <a href="https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html">https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html</a>.</p>
							<p>The project showcase track focuses on innovative cloud intelligence projects. Submissions should contain a brief description of the project including its goal, problem statement, solution, and deployment status if applicable. Preference will be given to projects that contribute to open source and open data. A project URL is recommended.</p>
