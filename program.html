                                                Dr. Dongmei Zhang is the Assistant Managing Director of Microsoft Research Asia (MSRA), leading the research of Data, Knowledge and Intelligence (DKI) which is an interdisciplinary area across data intelligence, knowledge computing, information visualization, and software engineering. Dr. Zhang founded the Software Analytics Group in MSRA in 2009. Since then she has been leading the group to research software analytics technologies. In addition to conducting state-of-the-art research, her group collaborates closely with multiple product teams in Microsoft, and has developed and deployed software analytics tools that have created high business impact. In recent years, Dr. Zhang and her teams have expanded the impact into the business intelligence area, and helped Microsoft establish technology leadership in the direction of Smart Data Discovery.

                                        Software Analytics focuses on utilizing data-driven approaches to help improve the quality of software systems, the user experience of interacting with software systems, and the productivity of software development process. Software Analytics is an important research area in the software engineering community for more than a decade. It has already made broad impact in software industry. As the computing paradigm was shifting towards cloud computing, we started to focus our Software Analytics research on cloud computing and created the research topic Cloud Intelligence. Cloud Intelligence targets at utilizing AI/ML technologies to help design, build, and operate high-quality and high-efficiency cloud systems at scale. Due to the distributed nature, great complexity, and enormous scale of cloud systems, Cloud Intelligence presents unique challenges and opportunities to the Software Analytics research. In this talk, I will first introduce the research landscape of software analytics and Cloud Intelligence. Then using a couple of projects as examples, I will talk about our research on Cloud Intelligence and its impact, as well as the research challenges and opportunities in Cloud Intelligence moving forward.

                                                <br />
                                                Cloud services are increasingly adopting new programming models, such as microservices and serverless compute. While these frameworks offer several advantages, such as better modularity, ease of maintenance and deployment, they also introduce new hardware and software challenges.  
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                In this talk, I will briefly discuss the challenges that these new cloud models introduce in hardware and software, and present some of our work on employing ML to improve the cloud’s performance predictability and resource efficiency. I will first discuss Seer, a performance debugging system that identifies root causes of unpredictable performance in multi-tier interactive microservices, and Sage, which improves on Seer by taking a completely unsupervised learning approach to data-driven performance debugging, making it both practical and scalable.

                                                <br />
                                                The vision of self-aware, self-healing and self-managing Information Technology (IT) systems has remained elusive till recently. Recent advancements in Cloud computing, Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Learning (ML), and Artificial Intelligence (AI) in general, are all making it possible to realize this vision now. AI can optimize IT operations management processes by increasing application availability, predicting and detecting problems early, reducing the time it takes to resolve problems, proactively avoiding problems, and optimizing the resources and cost of running business applications on hybrid Clouds. In this talk, I will discuss the opportunity for AI to optimize IT Operations Management. I will describe how semi-structured application and infrastructure logs can be analyzed to predict anomalies early, how entities can be extracted and linked from logs, alerts and events to reduce alert noise for IT operations admins, how NLP can be put to use on unstructured content in prior incident tickets to extract next-best-action recommendations to resolve problems, and how deployment change request descriptions can be analyzed in combination with past incident root cause information to predict risks of deployment changes to prevent issues from happening in the first place.

                                                    In his more than 15 years at Microsoft, Kleewein has worked on Office servers and services. While he began working on the lower layers of Exchange Server stack such as indexing, data storage, high availability, disaster recovery, and other bits of deep plumbing, as Office moved to the cloud so did he. He helped establish the architecture and implementation of O365 as both a hosted service and a self-hosted piece of enterprise software, started new technology initiatives such as the project that eventual became the Microsoft Graph and the advanced machine learning efforts that enable user action prediction like focused inbox, and regularly carried the ‘incident manager’ pager helping pragmatically assure the service was running correctly. Kleewein is listed as inventor of dozens of patents in the area of electronic communications, databases, data analytics, and hyper-scale cloud services. He is currently director of development for the core O365 hosted services, leading the worldwide team responsible for delivering Office productivity services to hundreds of millions of people every hour of every day.
