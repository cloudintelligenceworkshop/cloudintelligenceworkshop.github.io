                                        Services that rely heavily on Artificial Intelligence (AI), such as speech understanding and image recognition, have been receiving an enormous amount of attention. In the meanwhile, the ever increasing scale and complexity of cloud platform itself calls for leveraging more AI for building and managing cloud platform, to deliver highly efficient and reliable cloud service, enable high customer satisfaction, and achieve high engineering productivity. In this talk, I will first share our vision of infusing AI into Azure platform and DEVOps process, we call it intelligent cloud platform and AIOps. I will then give a brief overview of our AIOps efforts. I will also use Resource Central as a case study. Resource Central (RC) is a novel machine learning and prediction-serving system for improving cloud resource management. We are placing RC right at the center of Microsoft Azure. To conclude, I will discuss some lessons from deploying such research efforts in production and how they relate to academic research.

                                        Software Analytics focuses on utilizing data-driven approaches to help improve the quality of software systems, the user experience of interacting with software systems, and the productivity of software development process. Software analytics is an important research area in the software engineering community for more than a decade. It has already made broad impact in software industry.

                                        In the era of cloud computing, the entire software stack, ranging from user facing experiences to fundamental storage and computing platform, is often manifested as cloud services. Due to its distributed nature, great complexity and enormous scale, cloud services pose unique challenges and opportunities to the software analytics research. In particular, AIOps and AI for Software Systems are two emerging topics both researchers and practitioners are actively working on in recent years.

                                        In this talk, I will first introduce the research landscape of software analytics and cloud Intelligence. Then using a couple of projects as examples, I will talk about our research and impact in software analytics, as well as our experiences working with different product teams on joint innovations across Microsoft. I will also discuss the research challenges and opportunities in cloud Intelligence moving forward.

                                        All systems and applications are composed from basic data structures and algorithms, such as index structures, priority queues, and sorting algorithms. Most of these primitives have been around since the early beginnings of computer science (CS) and form the basis for every CS intro lecture. Yet, we might be in front of inflection point. A recent result by my group shows that machine learning has the potential to significantly alter the way those primitives are implemented and the performance they can provide.

                                        In this talk, I will use index structures, such as B-Trees, Hash-Maps, and Bloom-Filters, as an example to explain the intuition behind learned data structures and algorithms, and outline opportunities and existing research challenges for using this technology in practice.

                                        Cloud computing infrastructure is becoming ubiquitous worldwide. With the rapid growth of digitization and IoT devices, the need of large-scale Cloud infrastructure keeps increasing, which presents greater challenges to its management and operational efficiency. At Alibaba Cloud Intelligence, we focus on using data and the very best techniques that Cloud enables, such as AI algorithms, to manage the Cloud infrastructure itself in an autonomous fashion. In this talk, we give an overview of the top issues Cloud infrastructure operation is facing. Then we share some recent progress on specific topics such as Cloud resource capacity planning, fast datacenter anomaly detection, hardware failure prediction, cluster-level self-healing and so on.                                   </p>

                                                    Igal is focused on creating the best Cloud Compute platform in the industry. Igal is managing Fundamentals team of Azure Compute – high-availability, reliability, manageability, performance, scalability, security and supportability of the Cloud Infrastructure as well as IaaS and PaaS compute experiences on top of it. Igal’s team is focused on driving cross-team initiatives across Microsoft, encompassing the customer app and infrastructure high-availability and reliability, customer app lifecycle and performance, and platform scale and reliability. Igal’s team goal is to drive the creation and the optimization of the right customer experiences in a competitive world-class services platform. To implement this goal, Igal and his team apply data science and ML techniques to create self-managed and self-operated distributed platform which optimizes itself for the defined customer experiences and scenarios, heavily focused on generating insights, predict customer and platform behaviors, perform failure recovery and blast radius reduction, optimize cost and performance, and improve overall customer satisfaction. Igal is interested in partnering across industry and academy to advance solutions and methodologies pertaining to application of ML techniques in large scale distributed systems to optimize all the Fundamentals aspects of the Cloud, beyond what is feasible with manual operations – creating a Cloud that operates itself in a way it’s users want it to.
